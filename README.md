# NBA Game Notification System

This project is an **NBA Game Notification System** designed to send real-time notifications about NBA games using AWS services. The project integrates **AWS EventBridge**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Amazon SNS** to manage and send game notifications efficiently. It also leverages **AWS Systems Manager** to securely store and access environment variables, and **Terraform** to automate the infrastructure setup.

## ‚úÖ **Steps**  
1. **Event Triggering:**  
   - We configured **AWS EventBridge** to monitor NBA game events and trigger a Lambda function when a new event is detected.  

2. **Notification Handling:**  
   - The triggered **AWS Lambda** function processes the event and sends notifications using **Amazon SNS** to the subscribed users.  

3. **Environment Management:**  
   - We used **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** to securely store environment variables such as API keys and SNS topic ARNs.  

4. **Automation:**  
   - We used **Terraform** to automate the provisioning of AWS resources (EventBridge, Lambda, SNS, Systems Manager).
